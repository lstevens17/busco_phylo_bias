# Are BUSCO scores phylogenetically biased? 

## Motivation 
We recently received reviews for our manuscript on the genome of *C. bovis* and one of the helpful reviewers asked why the BUSCO completeness score was only 94.2% (with a further 4.6% of BUSCO genes being fragmented) despite the assembly comprising chromosome-scale contigs. They were rightfully concerned that this may be due to lingering sequencing errors resulting from noisy nanopore reads.
